<p>An MCB is an automatically operated electrical switch. Miniature circuit breakers are intended to prevent damage to an electrical circuit as a result of excess current. They are designed to trip during an overload or short circuit to protect against electrical faults and equipment failure.here are about six different types of MCB, which are A, B, C, D, K and Z. Firstly, Type A trips off the circuit when the current exceeds 2-3 times the actual current rating. Since this type is highly sensitive to short circuit, it is better suited for semiconductor devices.here are about six different types of MCB, which are A, B, C, D, K and Z.
